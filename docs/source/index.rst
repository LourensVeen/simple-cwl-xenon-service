Welcome to Cerise's documentation!
====================================================

Cerise is a simple REST service that can run (many) CWL jobs on a remote
compute resource, such as a remote server or HPC compute cluster. This
documentation explains how to set it up and use it, and also how it works on the
inside.

The implementation is fairly complete, and the main things needed are some
real-world testing, bug fixing, and polish.
