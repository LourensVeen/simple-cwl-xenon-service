Welcome to Cerise's documentation!
====================================================

Cerise is a simple REST service that can run (some) CWL jobs on some remote
compute resource. It uses a REST API as its interface and PyXenon
to run jobs remotely.

The implementation is fairly complete, and the main things needed are some
real-world testing, bug fixing, and polish.
